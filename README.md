# vehicles-node - backend

I used Node.js with Express and Mongoose on backend, and Angular framework on frontend. As there was no specified design I used Angular Material for out-of-box basic styles and for table and popup confirmation. 

There are 2 ways to search the database - exact-search filter and fuzzy filter (using mongoose-fuzzy-searching plugin with mongoose 5.13.9 - https://laptrinhx.com/mongoose-fuzzy-searching-plugin-4135242793 ). Results can be be additionally filtered using client-side fiter.
